A StatefulSet in Kubernetes is used to manage stateful applications — apps that need stable network identity, storage, and ordering.

🧠 Simple Definition:
A StatefulSet is like a Deployment, but for apps that need to remember who they are — even after restarting.

🔑 Key Features (in plain terms):
Stable pod names

Pods are named with a fixed index, like myapp-0, myapp-1, etc.

Even if the pod restarts, it gets the same name.

Persistent storage per pod

Each pod gets its own dedicated volume.

The storage stays even if the pod is deleted and recreated.

Ordered startup and shutdown

Pods are created one at a time and in order (-0 first, then -1, etc.).

Useful for apps that must start in sequence (like databases or clusters).

Stable network identity

Each pod gets a stable DNS name, like myapp-0.myapp — helps in peer-to-peer communication (e.g., in Cassandra, Kafka).

🔁 Use StatefulSet when:

Running databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL)

Running distributed systems (Kafka, Zookeeper)

You need stable storage and predictable naming
